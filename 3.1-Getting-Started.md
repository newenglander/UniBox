# Getting started with your JavaFX Application

After you set the UniBoxClient.jar as a required dependency of your project, your are able to set it up to suit your needs.

First of all you have to set your username and password together with the IP address of
the UniBoxServer instance. To be flexible, the API will provide different methods
for that task to fit your needs.

You can pass your credentials as parameters as follows:

```
java -jar YourGame.jar <ip> <user> <password>
```

If you prefer that way, simply add the following calls to your main():

```java
public static void main(final String[] args) {

	// init credentials
	ClientProvider.setIp(args[0]);
	ClientProvider.setUsername(args[1]);
	ClientProvider.setPassword(args[2]);

	Application.launch(args);

}
```

If you prefer a more static way you can place these methods in your start() method as well:

```
public final void start(final Stage primaryStage) {

	// init credentials

	ClientProvider.setIp("192.168.0.150");
	ClientProvider.setUsername("user");
	ClientProvider.setPassword("password");

	// ...

}
```

After the credentials and the IP have been set, you can call the login routine to register your
application to the backend service.

```
ClientProvider.login();
```

Now you have a valid cookie to talk to the backend workers via an authorized channel.
To start the main loop of the Client API, you have to connect the local workers/threads
of your application with the backend.

```
ClientProvider.connect();
```
